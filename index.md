Hi! I am Dulshani, and I like answering questions with data (and expressing myself with GIFs)

I am a Masters student in [Applied Social Data Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/methodology) at the London School of Economics and Political Science. In other words, I study how computational methods can be used understand the political and social world. 

I'm particularly interested in computational social science and fairness in AI systems. My ongoing dissertation uses topic modelling and deep learning to explore affective polarisation in online social platforms by comparing Reddit's [r/ChangeMyView](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/) with ideologically divided communities. 

Prior to my Masters, I worked for four years in Trust and Safety at Facebook: [pondering the evils of the internet](https://about.fb.com/news/2017/06/hard-questions-hate-speech/) and delving into operational data (while perfecting my SQL!).

I am a part-time Research Assistant at the [Care Policy and Evaluation Centre at LSE](https://www.lse.ac.uk/cpec), where I apply my coursework to understand the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on adult social care.
